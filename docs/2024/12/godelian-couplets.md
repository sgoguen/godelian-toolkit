# Gödelian Couplets

I asked ChatGPT to generate some couplets about Gödelian constructors. Here are some of the results:

* “No code drifts off into a vacant void; each integer’s form is deftly deployed.”
* “With balanced pairs, new patterns are born; each number’s code will never be torn.”
* “No random nonsense need we to mourn; bijection ensures each form is reborn.”
* “From simplest seeds to heights yet unborn, each mapping stands precise, never forlorn.”
* “As each integer’s shape is rightly drawn, the syntax steps forth, no aspect gone.”
* “By bijection’s grace, no code’s overdrawn; each mapping emerges clear as the dawn.”
* “No guessing remains once these rules are worn; each code aligns neat, bright as the morn.”
* “Across infinite scales no detail is shorn; from each integer springs a pattern reborn.”
* “As logic and math conspire to inform, bijection ensures no code misperforms.”
* “No empty integers left to deform; each mapping’s precision dares to inform.”
